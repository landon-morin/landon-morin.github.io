#### Mission
To create a fitness app for all devices that empowers and motivate its users to continue with their fitness goals. The app will take a unique approach to stat tracking and will provide an indepth timeline, or story, of the user's journey to their goals. Friends will be able to share their story and workout routines with others, empowering others to do the same!

Aspire to Inspire!

#### Why
I started off on this project as more of a goof than anything. I was getting tired of how bad data entry is on other apps, and how evernote was my only solution. I took it upon myself to make a fitness app that not only solved that problem, but would also solve my biggest foe, motivation.
